Site is based on [Agency](https://github.com/laklau/agency-jekyll-theme/) jekyll template with css changes taken from [Grayscale](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/grayscale/) template. Thank you.

Development
To test your web, run bundle exec jekyll serve and open your browser at http://localhost:4000. This starts a Jekyll server using your theme. Add pages, documents, data, etc. like normal to test your theme's contents. As you make modifications to your theme and to your content, your site will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh, just like normal.
